# 6.4 Protecting data in transit

## Services Used
* AWS Certificate Manager
* Elastic Load Balancing
* Amazon CloudFront


## Best Practices

1. Define data protection in transit requirements: Define data protection in transit requirements, such as encryption standards, based on data classification to meet your organizational, legal, and compliance requirements. Best practices are to encrypt and authenticate all traffic, and to enforce the latest standards and ciphers.
2. Implement secure key and certificate management: Store encryption keys and certificates securely and rotate them with strict access control; for example, by using a certificate management service such as AWS Certificate Manager.
3. Enforce encryption in transit: Enforce your defined encryption requirements based on the latest standards and best practices to help you meet your organizational, legal, and compliance requirements.
4. Automate detection of data leak: Use a tool or detection mechanism to automatically detect attempts to move data outside of defined boundaries; for example, to detect a database system that is copying data to an unknown host.
5. Authenticate network communications: Verify the identity of communications by using protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IPsec, to reduce the risk of data tampering or loss.
