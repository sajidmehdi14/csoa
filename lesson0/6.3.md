# 6.3 Protecting data at rest

## Services Used
* AWS KMS
* Amazon S3
* Amazon EBS
* Amazon Glacier


## Best Practices
1. Define data management and protection at rest requirements: Define data management and protection at rest requirements, such as encryption and data retention, to meet your organizational, legal, and compliance requirements.
2. Implement secure key management: Encryption keys must be stored securely, and rotated with strict access control; for example, by using a key management service such as AWS Key Management Service. Consider using different keys for segregation of different data classification levels and retention requirements.
3. Enforce encryption at rest: Enforce your defined encryption requirements based on the latest standards and best practices to help protect your data at rest.
4. Enforce access control: Enforce access control with least privileges and mechanisms, including backups, isolation, and versioning, to help protect your data at rest. Consider what data you have that is publicly accessible.
5. Provide mechanisms to keep people away from data: Keep all users away from directly accessing sensitive data. For example, provide a dashboard instead of direct access to a data store, and provide tools to indirectly manage the data.
